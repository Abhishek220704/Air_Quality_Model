# Air Quality Prediction Model

## Project Overview
The Air Quality Prediction Model is designed to analyze air quality data and predict pollution levels based on various environmental parameters. The model is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook and follows a structured machine learning pipeline.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is an air quality dataset stored in an Excel file (`air quality data.xls`). It contains various air quality indicators such as pollutant concentrations, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.

## Features and Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data loading and exploration
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and engineering
   
2. **Model Training**
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
   - Selecting and implementing a machine learning model
   - Training the model on historical air quality data

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, and R-squared
   - Visualizing predictions versus actual values

## Dependencies
To run the notebook successfully, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook and dataset.
2. Open the notebook (`airqualitymodel.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run each cell sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
4. Modify parameters as needed to fine-tune the model.

## Results and Insights
- The model provides predictions for air quality based on historical data.
- Insights can be derived from data visualization and evaluation metrics to improve the model further.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate deep learning techniques for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
- Integrate more external environmental datasets for improved generalization.
